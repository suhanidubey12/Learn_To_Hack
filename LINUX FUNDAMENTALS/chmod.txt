General Description - chmod stands for "change mode".
It controls who can read, write, or execute a file or directory.

In cybersecurity terms:
chmod is about permissions, privilege escalation, and misconfigurations — which are everywhere in CTFs.

Before understanding the imp chmod flags one must understand linux permission basics.

So, every file has 3 permission groups and 3 permission types. These are-

Group	   Meaning
User	   File owner
Group	   Group members
Others	   Everyone else

Permission types:

Permission	   Symbol	   Meaning
Read	       r	       View file
Write	       w	       Modify file
Execute	       x	       Run file

Example: -rwxr-xr--

Meaning:
User → rwx (full access)
Group → r-x (read + execute)
Others → r-- (read only)

### IMPORTANT chmod FLAGS & MODES (CTF-relevant)

1. Numeric mode

Example: chmod 755 script.sh

Meaning:
7 → rwx (user)
5 → r-x (group)
5 → r-x (others)

Common values:

Number	   Meaning
777	       Everyone can do everything 
755	       Executable scripts
644    	   Normal files
600	       Private secrets


2. +x → To Make a file executable

Example: chmod +x exploit.sh

Without this, your script will not run, no matter how correct it is.



3. -x, -r, -w → To Remove Permissions

Example: chmod -x flag.txt



4️. u, g, o, a → Permission targets

Example: chmod u+x file.sh -> This is a precision control.

Targets:
u → user
g → group
o → others
a → all

Example: chmod o-r secret.txt -> Removes read access from others.



5️. -R → Recursive permissions

Example: chmod -R 755 folder/

CTF use:
-Fix broken extracted archives
-Make entire challenge directories usable
