Breif Descrption of echo:
The echo command is used to display text or variables to the terminal. It’s very commonly used in shell scripting and command-line output.
Flags used:

-> -n   Suppress the trailing newline.

        Normally, echo prints a newline at the end. Using -n keeps the cursor on the same line.
Example:echo -n "Hello"
        echo "World"
        # Output: HelloWorld (on same line)





-> -e   Enable interpretation of backslash escapes like \n, \t, etc.
Example:echo -e "Hello\nWorld"
        # Output:
        # Hello
        # World



-> -E (default on most systems)   Disable interpretation of backslash escapes.
                                  example:  echo -E "Hello\nWorld"
                                  # Output: Hello\nWorld (prints literally)

*On most Linux systems, echo is a shell builtin, so its behavior can slightly differ between Bash, Zsh, etc.
