# 🚩 Challenge 1: The Hidden Flag

### 🎯 Objective
A file has been hosted containing thousands of lines of random text. Somewhere inside, a secret flag is hidden. Your mission is to download the file and find the flag using **only the terminal**.

**Flag Format:** `geek{flag_content}`

---

### 📝 Instructions

1.  **Download the File:**
    Use a terminal command (like `wget` or `curl`) to download the challenge file.
    
2.  **Find the Flag:**
    The file is too large to read manually. You must use a Linux command line tool to filter through the file and find the specific flag format mentioned above.

    > **💡 Hint:** You need a standard Linux utility that is used to **search** for specific patterns or strings within a file. It is the most common tool for "global regular expression print."

### 🚫 Constraints
* **Terminal Only:** Do not open the text file in a GUI text editor.
* **No Manual Scrolling:** Do not read the file line-by-line using `cat`.

3.  **Proof:** A Google Drive link (or similar) to a **screenshot** of your terminal showing the command execution and the output.
