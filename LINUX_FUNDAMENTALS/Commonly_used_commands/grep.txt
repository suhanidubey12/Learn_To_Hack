Description
The grep command is basically a "search" tool for your terminal. It scans through files or lists to find lines that match the text you are looking for. Whether you are hunting for a specific error in a long log file or trying to find a piece of code in a big project, grep helps you find it instantly.

Basic Syntax
grep [OPTIONS] "TEXT_TO_FIND" [FILE_NAME]

Useful Flags
1. -i (Ignore Case) 
This tells grep not to worry about capital letters. It will find "error", "Error", and "ERROR" all at the same time. Example: grep -i "failed" login.log

2. -v (Invert Search) 
This does the opposite of a normal search. It shows you everything EXCEPT the word you typed. It is perfect for hiding boring info messages so you can see the real problems. Example: grep -v "info" server.log

3. -n (Show Line Numbers) 
This puts the line number next to every result. It is very helpful when you need to know exactly where to go in a file to fix something. Example: grep -n "config_hidden" settings.conf

4. -r (Search Everything) 
This is the "recursive" flag. Instead of looking at just one file, it looks through every single file inside a folder and all its sub-folders. Example: grep -r "password" ./backup_folder

5. -l (List Files Only) 
If you don't care about seeing the actual text and just want to know WHICH files contain your word, use this. It only prints the filenames. Example: grep -l "TODO" ./source_code
