`strace` is a command that traces system calls made by a program.

It is commonly used in CTFs and cybersecurity to understand how a program
interacts with the operating system, accesses files, executes commands,
or fails due to permission issues.

Syntax:
strace [options] <command>

Some flags commonly used alongside `strace`

-> `-o <file>` - writes the trace output to a file.
-> `-f` - traces child processes created by the program.
-> `-e trace=<syscall>` - traces specific system calls only.
-> `-p <pid>` - attaches strace to a running process.
-> `-c` - shows a summary of system call statistics.
