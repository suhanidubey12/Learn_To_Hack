#Description : 
wget is a command-line tool used to download files from the web using HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP.
It is especially useful in CTFs, penetration testing, scripting, and servers without a GUI—because you can quietly pull files, payloads, web pages, and resources directly from a terminal.


# wget has many options:- 

1. -O <file> — Save Output to a Specific File
wget -O output.txt http://example.com/page


Normally, wget saves files using their original name.
-O lets you rename the downloaded file.

Useful when:
- dumping webpage content
- storing results for later analysis

2️. -c — Continue / Resume Download
wget -c http://example.com/bigfile.iso


If the download stops (network drop, disconnect, etc.), -c allows you to resume from where it stopped, not restart.

Very useful for:
- large files
- unstable connections

3️. -q — Quiet Mode
wget -q http://example.com/file


Suppresses output — no progress bar, no logs.
Useful in scripts or stealth-style operations.

Combine with:
wget -q URL -O file

4️. -r — Recursive Download (Download Entire Site/Directory)
wget -r http://example.com/folder/


Downloads files recursively — meaning it follows directories and links.

Often used in CTFs to pull:
- hidden directories
- backup folders
- entire file repositories

 Use carefully — it can download a LOT.

5️. -l <level> — Set Recursion Depth
wget -r -l 2 http://example.com


Limits how deep recursion goes.

Example:

-l 1 → only current page + direct links

-l 2 → one more level deeper

Prevents downloading the whole internet 

6️. -p — Download Page Resources
wget -p http://example.com


Downloads all resources needed to display a webpage, like:
- images
- scripts
- stylesheets

So you can view it offline.

7️. -m — Mirror a Site
wget -m http://example.com


Equivalent to combining:

-r -N -l inf --no-remove-listing


This is website mirroring mode — great for archiving.

8️. --user & --password — HTTP Auth Login
wget --user=username --password=pass http://example.com


Used when a site requires login authentication.

Useful in CTF web challenges.

9️. -U <agent> — Change User-Agent
wget -U "Mozilla/5.0" http://example.com



# Common CTF-Style Examples
Download a file
wget http://example.com/file.txt

Download and rename
wget -O secret.txt http://example.com/data

Resume interrupted download
wget -c file.iso

Mirror a site
wget -m http://example.com

Recursive with depth limit
wget -r -l 2 http://example.com

Quiet + save to file
wget -q URL -O loot.txt
