rsync — Remote File Synchronization Command

DESCRIPTION
rsync is a fast and versatile command-line utility used for copying and synchronizing
files and directories between two locations. These locations can be on the same system
or across different systems over a network (using SSH).

rsync is efficient because it transfers only the differences between source and destination
files, making it faster than traditional copy commands.

BASIC SYNTAX
rsync [OPTIONS] SOURCE DESTINATION

EXAMPLE
rsync -av source_folder/ destination_folder/

COMMONLY USED FLAGS

-a, --archive
Enables archive mode. This preserves symbolic links, permissions, ownership, timestamps,
and recursively copies directories. It is the most commonly used flag.

Example:
rsync -a source/ destination/

-v, --verbose
Displays detailed information about the files being transferred.

Example:
rsync -av source/ destination/

-z, --compress
Compresses file data during the transfer. Useful when transferring data over a network
to save bandwidth.

Example:
rsync -avz source/ user@remote:/backup/

--progress
Shows the progress of each file being transferred, including speed and remaining time.

Example:
rsync -av --progress source/ destination/

--delete
Deletes files in the destination directory that no longer exist in the source directory.
⚠️ Use with caution.

Example:
rsync -av --delete source/ destination/

-r, --recursive
Copies directories recursively. This flag is included automatically when using -a.

Example:
rsync -r source/ destination/

-e, --rsh=COMMAND
Specifies the remote shell to use, commonly SSH.

Example:
rsync -av -e ssh source/ user@remote:/backup/

--dry-run
Performs a trial run without making any actual changes. Useful for testing commands safely.

Example:
rsync -av --dry-run source/ destination/

-h, --human-readable
Outputs numbers in a human-readable format (KB, MB, GB).

Example:
rsync -avh source/ destination/

SUMMARY
rsync is widely used for backups, mirroring directories, deploying files to servers,
and synchronizing data efficiently. Its ability to transfer only changed data makes it
extremely powerful for both local and remote file operations.
