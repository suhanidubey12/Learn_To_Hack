Touch is used to create empty file from terminal or to update timestamp of existing file.

If for example you typed-
"
touch example.txt
"
then if example.txt does not exist in your current directory, then touch will create example.txt empty file in current working directory.
If it exist then it will change its atime and mtime to current time.

Flags:
1. -a : to change only access time.
2. -m : to change only modification time.
3. -c : it does not create new file, if file does not exist then nothing will happen. If it exist then timestamp is updated.
4. -d <string> : Allow natural language time string.
5. -t : set time in numeric format.
