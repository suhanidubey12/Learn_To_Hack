Command: sed

Description:
sed (Stream Editor) is a powerful text-processing utility used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (file or standard input).
It is commonly used in cybersecurity and CTFs for log analysis, payload modification, pattern replacement, and automation tasks.

Useful Flags:

-n
Suppresses automatic printing of pattern space.
Used when you want to explicitly control output using the 'p' command.

-e
Allows you to specify multiple editing commands in one sed execution.
Useful for chaining multiple operations.

-f
Reads sed commands from a file instead of the command line.
Helpful for complex or reusable transformations.

-i
Edits files in-place.
Commonly used when modifying configuration files or scripts directly.

-r
Enables extended regular expressions.
Simplifies regex patterns by removing the need for excessive escaping.

Examples:
sed 's/password/*******/g' file.txt
sed -n '/admin/p' access.log
sed -i 's/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/g' config.txt
