Description
htop is an interactive system-monitor process-viewer and manager. It is designed as a more modern, colorful, and user-friendly alternative to the classic top command. It allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally, see full command lines, and manage processes using your mouse or keyboard shortcuts.

htop [OPTIONS]

Opens a menu to sort the process list by various columns like CPU%, MEM%, PID, or Priority.

Allows you to send signals (like SIGTERM or SIGKILL) to a selected process to stop or restart it without needing to manually type the PID.
