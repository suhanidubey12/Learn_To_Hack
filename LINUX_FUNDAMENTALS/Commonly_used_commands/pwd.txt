'pwd' stands for present working directory.

This helps the user disaply the full path of whatever directory they are working in from the root directory

This has two flags:
   '-L' (logical) this obtains the symbolic path of a directory (if the path contains a symbolic link)
   '-P' (physical) this obtains the actual path, ignoring any symbolic links
