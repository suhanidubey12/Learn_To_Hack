## 📝 Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Linux
Install and configure your Linux distribution. Open your terminal to verify that it is running.

### Step 2: Capture Proof

* *Tip: To prove it's your machine, you might want to run the `whoami` or `date` command before taking the screenshot.*

### Step 3: Upload to Drive
1.  Upload your screenshot to **Google Drive**.
2.  **Important:** Change the sharing settings to **"Anyone with the link"** (Viewer) so we can view your submission without requesting access.

### Step 4: Create Your Submission
1.  Navigate to the `CONTRIBUTORS` folder in this repository.
2.  Open the folder named after your **GitHub Username / ID**.
    * *If you haven't created your folder yet, create a new folder inside `CONTRIBUTORS/` named exactly as your GitHub username(which was the first issue).*
3.  Inside your folder, create a new text file named:
    `task1.txt`
4.  Paste your Google Drive link into this file and save it.
